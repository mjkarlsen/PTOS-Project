# Overview of Compartment Syndrome

## What is Compartment Syndrome?


<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

- Compartment syndrome refers to the <b>increased pressure</b> inside the section of the limb that contains muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. 
- This increased pressure results in the reduction of blood supply and tissue necrosis. 
- It usually develops in the lower leg and forearm after traumas like a bone fracture. 
  - If not treated in time, it can lead to <b> permanent muscle and nerve damage. </b>

## When does Compartment Syndrome occur?
- Compartment Syndrome typically develops after surgery or trauma, causing excessive fluid in the fascia, causing pressure and pain in the affected limb. 
- The decreased circulation causes the muscle can die, resulting in permanent damage left untreated.

## How is Compartment Syndrome treated?

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

- Treatment of compartment syndrome is a fasciotomy or removal of external compression, which can relieve the pressure and maintains blood flow to the muscle.

# Objective

## Objective
Identify the likelihood of <em> compartment syndrome </em> in pediatric patients (less than seventeen years old) who suffered from <em> forearm fractures </em>.

<strong> Challenges with Data </strong>

- Compartment Syndrome diagnosis is typically not accurate or reliable
  - Models will focus on predicting Fasciotomy 
- Forearm Fractures does not contain details to distinguish between right or left arms 
  - Duplicate codes for forearm factures will be removed and counted once


## Fasciotomy Results in PTOS Data

<div style = "font-size: 18px">
- Patients results between 2010 to 2015
- PTOS contains 630 patients that had forearm surgery and complications from compartment syndrome
