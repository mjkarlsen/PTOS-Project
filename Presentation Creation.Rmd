# Overview of Compartment Syndrome

## What is Compartment Syndrome?

<div style="font-size: 22px">
In this study, we will use <b>Fasciotomy</b> as the indicator for <b>Compartment Syndrome</b>. 
</div>

<div style="font-size: 20px">
- We did this for the following reasons:
  - Compartment Syndrome is a diagnosis that is subject to human error
    - The PTOS results are sparse in terms of date, time, and accuracy of diagnosis
  - Fasciotomy is a procedure that takes place because of Compartment Syndrome
    - This is a surgical procedure and it is well documented in the PTOS data

# Overview of Forearm Factures

## ORdered Test

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

## Four Types of Forearm Fracture Treatments

1. <b>Open Reduction with Internal Fixation</b>
    + Most common and preferred method for forearm fracture treatment
2. <b>Closed Reduction without Internal Fixation</b>
    + Involves manually setting the bone back into place and use of hard cast for stability
3. <b>Closed Reduction with Internal Fixation</b>
    + Not a surgical procedure, Minor incision in forearm using pins for stability
4. <b>Open Reduction without Internal Fixation</b>
    + Surgical procedure, only performed if there is no need for internal fixator

<br>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%; font-size: 18px">

- These <b>are</b> surgical procedures
- More traumatic fractures requiring invasive techniques
- Use of plates, screws, and external cast to secure fracture site
- Patients are <b>sedated</b> using anesthesia

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%; font-size: 18px">

- These are <b>not</b> surgical procedures
- Technique performed by <b>manipulation</b> for less traumatic fractures
- Use of pins and cast to hold bones in place for healing
- Painful technique for patient and performed with or without general anesthetic 

</div>

## Forearm Fracture Results in PTOS

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
![](images/gt_graph_4.png){width=600px}
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 35%; font-size: 20px">
- The Open Reduction with Internal Fixation is the most common technique across the nation
  - PTOS data show similar results 
- Pediatric patients tend to be treated with Closed Reduction and casting
  - Most of the injuries result from falling on the playground or at home
  - These fractures are usually less traumatic and do not require invasive techniques

</div>


# Objective

## Objective
Identify the likelihood of <em> compartment syndrome </em> in pediatric patients (less than seventeen years old) who suffered from <em> forearm fractures </em>.

<strong> Challenges with Data </strong>

- Compartment Syndrome diagnosis is typically not accurate or reliable
  - Models will focus on predicting Fasciotomy 
- Forearm Fractures does not contain details to distinguish between right or left arms 
  - Duplicate codes for forearm factures will be removed and counted once


## Fasciotomy Results in PTOS Data

![](images/gt_graph_1.png){width=1000px}

<div style = "font-size: 18px">
- Patients results between 2010 to 2015
- PTOS contains 630 patients that had forearm surgery and complications from compartment syndrome 
</div>

## Fasciotomy Results 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
![](images/gt_graph_2.png){width=600px}
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 35%; font-size: 18px">
- Higher percentage of patients need a fasciotomy when forearm surgery requires open incision
- Another bullet point
- One more for good luck
