# Objective

## Objective

- The objective is to identify the likelihood of acute compartment syndrome in pediatric patients (less than seventeen years old) who suffered from forearm fractures. 
- I plan to study those who likely had more severe injuries or who had an unacceptable result from their treatment in the emergency department.  
- The majority of forearm fractures in children are treated with closed reduction and casting.  

# Compartment Syndrome{.flexbox .vcenter}

## What is Compartment Syndrome?

- Compartment syndrome refers to the increased pressure inside the section of the limb that contains muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. 
- This increased pressure results in the reduction of blood supply and tissue necrosis. 
- It usually develops in the lower leg and forearm after traumas like a bone fracture. If not treated in time, it can lead to permanent muscle and nerve damage.

# When does Compartment Syndrome occur?

## When does Compartment Syndrome occur?
- Compartment Syndrome typically develops after surgery or trauma, causing excessive fluid in the fascia, causing pressure and pain in the affected limb. 
- The decreased circulation causes the muscle can die, resulting in permanent damage left untreated.

## How is Compartment Syndrome treated?

<div class="rows-2">

- Treatment of compartment syndrome is a fasciotomy or removal of external compression, which can relieve the pressure and maintains blood flow to the muscle.

## Fasciotomy Results in PTOS Data

- PTOS contains 630 patients that had forearm surgery and complications from compartment syndrome

- Higher percentage of patients need a fasciotomy when forearm surgery requires open incision
- Another bullet point
- One more for good luck
